// single coordinator through broadcast.Broadcast, each producer holding an
// await-free CPU span (the transpiled chksum/gzip transform shape). It mirrors
// ConcurrentQueue.WaitIdle's wait/wake at a raised concurrency to test whether
// the transpiled broadcast wait channel loses a wakeup or starves at 16 under
// GoScript's cooperative scheduler. broadcast.Broadcast is transpiled from Go
