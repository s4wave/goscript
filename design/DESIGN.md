# GoScript Design Document

## Introduction

GoScript translates Go code to TypeScript. This document outlines the design principles, translation strategies, and known divergences from Go semantics. The goal is to produce idiomatic, readable, and maintainable TypeScript code that preserves the core logic and type safety of the original Go code where possible.

## Core Principles

1.  **Owner-separated pipeline:** Keep package loading, semantic analysis, lowering, runtime helper contracts, override package handling, and TypeScript text emission in separate owners.
2.  **Type Preservation:** Preserve Go's static typing as much as possible using TypeScript's type system.
3.  **Value Semantics:** Emulate Go's value semantics for basic types and structs using copying where necessary. Pointers are used to emulate reference semantics when Go uses pointers. See [VarRefes and Pointers](#varRefes-and-pointers).
4.  **Idiomatic TypeScript:** Generate TypeScript code that feels natural to TypeScript developers, even if it means minor divergences from exact Go runtime behavior (e.g., `for range` loop variable scoping).
5.  **Readability:** Prioritize clear and understandable generated code.

## Compiler Architecture (v2)

Public entrypoints are adapters over one compiler service:

*   `cmd/goscript` is the CLI adapter. It uses `github.com/aperturerobotics/cli` for command and flag parsing, normalizes flags into `compiler.Config`, and then calls the public Go compiler adapter.
*   `compiler.Compiler` is the public Go API. It owns logger/config storage only and forwards package patterns to `CompileService`.
*   `compiler/wasm` is the browser/WASM API adapter. It supports import-free single-file browser source strings by parsing and type-checking a synthetic package before reusing the same semantic, lowering, and TypeScript emitter owners as package compilation. Browser source imports return a structured diagnostic; imported code should use the package workflow.

`CompileService` owns the v2 compile pipeline:

1.  `CompileRequestOwner` normalizes adapter inputs and rejects invalid requests before output is written. Package patterns such as `.` or `./pkg` are supported from inside a Go module; direct `.go` file inputs are rejected with `goscript/request:single-file-unsupported`.
2.  `PackageGraphOwner` loads Go packages with `go/packages`, using `GOOS=js`, `GOARCH=wasm`, and caller-supplied build flags.
3.  `SemanticModelOwner` computes package, file, type, method, addressability, async, interface, generic, and override facts.
4.  `OverrideRegistryOwner` discovers handwritten `gs/` packages, validates metadata/dependencies, supplies async method and parity ledger facts, builds copy plans, and copies required runtime/override packages.
5.  `LoweringOwner` converts the semantic model and Go AST into GoScript's compiler-owned intermediate model. Unsupported syntax produces structured lowering diagnostics before emission.
6.  `TypeScriptEmitOwner` renders deterministic semicolon-free TypeScript files and package indexes only from the lowered model.

This means generated TypeScript text should not re-query package loader state, rebuild semantic facts, or duplicate runtime helper names locally. Shared helper names and `@goscript/builtin/index.ts` import policy come from `RuntimeContractOwner`.

## Translation Strategies

### Packages and Modules

*   Go packages are translated into TypeScript modules (ES modules).
*   Each Go file within a package is typically translated into a corresponding TypeScript file.
*   The `main` package is translated like any other package. The `main` function is exported as `export async function main(): Promise<void>` to serve as the entry point, and generated `package main` modules include a main-script guard that calls `main()` when the module is executed directly.
*   Imports are translated to TypeScript `import` statements. The GoScript runtime is imported as `@goscript/builtin/index.ts` in generated source.

#### Explicit deferred functions

`DeferredFunctions` (CLI `--deferred-function`, TypeScript `deferredFunctions`) names exported, non-generic package functions by full import path and function name. Calls from outside the selected packages use `import()` and participate in ordinary async propagation. Taking a function value creates an async callable without importing the module. ES module evaluation owns initialization: concurrent first calls share evaluation, and an evaluation failure rejects subsequent calls without rerunning `init()`.

This option deliberately delays package initialization until first use. Unconfigured builds retain eager imports. Selected packages may statically import each other to form a feature closure. Other callers may reference selected functions and erased interface types; references to package variables, constants, concrete types, unselected functions, or blank/dot imports produce a diagnostic. Shared declarations belong in a separate eager package. The compiler emits the dynamic boundary; the bundler determines the resulting chunks, including dependencies shared with the eager graph. Deferred selections are part of compiler cache identity.

### Types

*   **Basic Types:** Go basic types (`int`, `string`, `bool`, `float64`, etc.) are mapped to corresponding TypeScript types.
    *   `int`, `uint`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` -> `number`
    *   `int64`, `uint64` -> `bigint` (64-bit values must not be hidden behind `number` casts)
    *   `float64`, `float32` -> `number`
    *   `string` -> `string`
    *   `bool` -> `boolean`
    *   `rune` -> `number` (Unicode code point)
    *   `byte` -> `number`
    *   `error` -> `$.GoError` (interface `{ Error(): string } | null`)
*   **Composite Types:**
    *   **Structs:** Translated to TypeScript classes. Fields are mapped to class properties. Value semantics are maintained by cloning instances on assignment or passing as arguments, unless pointers are used. See the [Type Mapping](#type-mapping) section for detailed struct translation rules.
    *   **Arrays:** Translated to TypeScript arrays (`T[]`). Go's fixed-size nature might require runtime checks or specific handling if strictness is needed.
    *   **Slices:** Translated to the `$.Slice<T>` type which is a union: `T[] | SliceProxy<T> | null`. For `[]byte`, the type `$.Bytes` (which is `Uint8Array | $.Slice<number>`) is used. The runtime provides helper functions for slice operations.
    *   **Maps:** Translated to TypeScript `Map<K, V>` through `$.makeMap`. The runtime indexes string keys by their byte values and flat structs containing only strings by their field names and byte values. Struct buckets use the shared Go comparison routine to decide equality; updates retain the original stored key. Other comparable keys use the existing comparison scan.
    *   **Channels:** Translated using the `$.Channel<T>` interface from the runtime. Channel operations (`send`, `receive`, `receiveWithOk`) are async and use Promises.
    *   **Interfaces:** Translated to TypeScript interfaces. Type assertions and type switches require runtime type information or helper functions. See the [Type Mapping](#type-mapping) section for detailed interface translation rules including embedded interfaces and type assertions.
    *   **Pointers:** Translated using a `$.VarRef<T>` wrapper type from the runtime. See [VarRefes and Pointers](#varRefes-and-pointers).
*   **Function Types:** Translated to TypeScript function types.

### Variables and Constants

*   `var` declarations are translated to `let`. Type inference is used where possible. Zero values are assigned explicitly.
*   `const` declarations are translated to `const`.
*   Short variable declarations (`:=`) are translated to `let` with type inference.

### Control Flow

*   **`if`/`else`:** Translated directly to TypeScript `if`/`else`. Scoped simple statements (`if x := foo(); x > 0`) are handled by declaring the variable before the `if`.
*   **`switch`:** Type switches are translated using runtime type information. Expression switches are not part of the current v2 compiler yet and currently report an unsupported lowering diagnostic.
*   **`for`:**
    *   Standard `for` loops (`for init; cond; post`) are translated directly to TypeScript `for` loops.
    *   `for cond` loops are translated to TypeScript `while (cond)`.
    *   `for {}` loops are translated to `while (true)`.
    *   **`for range`:** Translated to indexed `for` loops or `for...of` depending on the type being ranged over.
        *   **Arrays/Slices:** Translated to indexed `for` loops using `$.len()`:
            ```typescript
            // Go: for i, v := range mySlice { ... }
            // TS: for (let i = 0; i < $.len(mySlice); i++) { let v = mySlice![i]; ... }

            // Go: for i := range mySlice { ... }
            // TS: for (let i = 0; i < $.len(mySlice); i++) { ... }
            ```
        *   **Maps:** Translated using `.entries()`:
            ```typescript
            // Go: for k, v := range myMap { ... }
            // TS: for (const [k, v] of myMap?.entries() ?? []) { ... }
            ```
        *   **Strings:** Translated using `$.stringToRunes()` to properly iterate over Unicode code points:
            ```typescript
            // Go: for i, r := range myString { ... }
            // TS: { const _runes = $.stringToRunes(myString); for (let i = 0; i < _runes.length; i++) { let r = _runes[i]; ... } }
            ```
        *   **Integers (Go 1.22+):** `for i := range N` translates to `for (let i = 0; i < N; i++)`.
        *   **Channels:** Translated to infinite loops with `$.chanRecvWithOk()` that break when the channel is closed.
*   **`defer`:** Translated using TypeScript's `using` declarations with `$.DisposableStack` (for sync defers) or `await using` with `$.AsyncDisposableStack` (for async defers). Deferred functions are added via `.defer()` and execute in LIFO order when the scope exits.
*   **`go`:** Translated to `queueMicrotask(async () => { ... })`. See [Goroutines](#goroutines) for details.
*   **`select`:** Translated using the `$.selectStatement()` runtime helper. See [Control Flow: `select` Statements](#control-flow-select-statements) for details.

### Functions and Methods

*   Go functions are translated to TypeScript functions.
*   Go methods are translated to TypeScript class methods.
*   Multiple return values are handled by returning tuples (arrays) or objects. The call site uses destructuring assignment.
*   Variadic functions (`...T`) are translated using rest parameters (`...args: T[]`).

### Operators

*   Most operators map directly (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`).
*   Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `&^`, `<<`, `>>`) require runtime helper functions (`$.bitAnd()`, etc.) especially for integer types beyond JavaScript's standard number representation or for correct handling of signed vs unsigned shifts.
*   Pointer operations (`*`, `&`) are handled via the `$.VarRef<T>` type and its methods/properties (e.g., `*p` becomes `p.value`, `&x` becomes `$.varRef(x)` or handled implicitly via assignment).

### Concurrency

Go's goroutines and channels are mapped to TypeScript's `async/await` and custom runtime implementations for channels. See [Asynchronous Operations](#asynchronous-operations-asyncawait) for detailed coverage of function coloring, channel operations, goroutines, and the `select` statement.

### Error Handling

Go's explicit error return values are maintained. Functions returning an error typically have a TypeScript signature like `(...args: TArgs) => [TResult, $.error]` or `(...args: TArgs) => $.error`. Call sites check the error value.

### Builtin Functions

*   `len()`: Mapped to `$.len()` runtime helper which handles arrays, slices, maps, strings, and channels.
*   `cap()`: Mapped to `$.cap()` runtime helper for slices and channels.
*   `append()`: Mapped to `$.append()` runtime helper.
*   `make()`: Mapped to runtime helper functions (`$.makeSlice()`, `$.makeMap()`, `$.makeChannel()`).
*   `new()`: Mapped to `new T()`, returning a new instance of the zero value.
*   `copy()`: Mapped to `$.copy()` runtime helper. When both operands are two-index byte-slice expressions with inert local values and bounds, the compiler emits `$.copyByteRanges()` to avoid temporary slice views. The runtime checks destination and source bounds before copying, preserves capacity and overlap behavior, and supports both typed and Array-backed byte slices. Calls, package-variable reads, and other potentially effectful operands retain ordinary slice evaluation.
*   `delete()`: Mapped to `$.deleteMapEntry()` runtime helper.
*   `close()`: Mapped to `channel.close()` method call.
*   `panic()`: Mapped to `$.panic()` which throws an Error.
*   `recover()`: Mapped to `$.recover()` (simplified implementation, returns null).
*   `print()`/`println()`: Mapped to `$.println()` which uses `console.log`.
*   `min()`/`max()`: Mapped directly to `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`.
*   `clear()`: Mapped to `$.clear()` which empties maps or zeroes slice elements.
*   `byte()`: Mapped to `$.byte()` for byte conversion.
*   `int()`: Mapped to `$.int()` which uses `Math.trunc()` for integer truncation.
*   `uint` normalization uses `$.uint()`. Finite numbers at 8-, 16-, and 32-bit widths take a small bitwise fast path; other widths, encoded integers, non-finite inputs, and string-header values retain the general conversion. Full-width unsigned values beyond the exact JavaScript number range remain `bigint` at runtime.

### Generic Method Calls

Generated generic functions and methods receive a leading `__typeArgs` dictionary containing runtime descriptors. Inferred calls to methods with their own type parameters on a non-generic receiver use the same inference helper as generic function calls. Receiver type arguments continue to use the existing receiver dictionary path.

Methods with both receiver and method type parameters remain unsupported: the declaration currently emits two parameters named `__typeArgs`. Supporting that shape requires one combined dictionary at declarations and calls.

### Variable References and Pointers

See `design/VAR_REFS.md`. Go pointers are represented using a `$.VarRef<T>` wrapper type provided by the runtime. This allows emulating pointer semantics (shared reference, ability to modify the original value indirectly) in TypeScript.

*   Taking the address (`&x`): Often implicit when assigning to a variable expecting a `$.VarRef<T>`, or explicitly `$.varRef(x)`.
*   Dereferencing (`*p`): Accessing the `p.value` property.
*   Pointer assignment (`p = q`): Assigns the `$.VarRef` reference.
*   Assigning to dereferenced pointer (`*p = y`): Modifying `p.value = y`.

Value types (structs, basic types) are copied on assignment unless they are variable references.

## Runtime (`@goscript/builtin`)

The runtime provides:

*   Helper types (`$.GoError`, `$.Slice`, `$.Bytes`, `$.Channel`, `$.VarRef`, `$.DisposableStack`, `$.AsyncDisposableStack`, etc.).
*   Helper functions:
    *   Slice operations: `$.makeSlice`, `$.goSlice`, `$.append`, `$.copy`, `$.copyByteRanges`, `$.len`, `$.cap`, `$.clear`
    *   Map operations: `$.makeMap`, `$.mapGet`, `$.mapSet`, `$.deleteMapEntry`
    *   Channel operations: `$.makeChannel`, `$.chanSend`, `$.chanRecv`, `$.chanRecvWithOk`, `$.selectStatement`
    *   String operations include `$.indexString`, `$.stringLen`, `$.stringToRunes`, `$.stringToBytes`, and `$.bytesToString`. Length and byte indexing read ASCII strings directly without allocating an encoded byte array. Other strings retain UTF-8 byte access and the binary-string representation for invalid UTF-8; explicit string-to-byte conversion still creates independent storage.
    *   Pointer/value operations: `$.varRef`, `$.unref`, `$.isVarRef`, `$.pointerValue`, `$.markAsStructValue`, `$.assignStruct`
    *   Type operations: `$.typeAssert`, `$.mustTypeAssert`, `$.typeSwitch`, `$.is`, `$.typedNil`
    *   Function/generic operations: `$.namedFunction`, `$.genericZero`, `$.callGenericMethod`
    *   Control flow: `$.panic`, `$.recover`, `$.println`, `$.isMainScript`
    *   Math: `$.int`, `$.byte`
*   Runtime type information utilities (`$.registerStructType`, `$.registerInterfaceType`, `$.getTypeByName`, `$.TypeKind`). Basic descriptors use `$.basicType(name, typeName?)` to keep emitted metadata compact. Each call returns a fresh descriptor; named identity and reflection contents remain unchanged. Struct registration accepts field and method factories, evaluated independently on the first synchronous read and then retained. Registration still publishes the constructor and type name immediately; reflection observes the complete mutable arrays.

Generated protobuf adapters declare their Go method types and install binary, JSON, clone, equality, and reset forwarding methods through the shared protobuf bridge. Installation occurs in the class static block, captures the declaring constructor for nil receiver calls, and preserves non-enumerable prototype methods. Handwritten methods and native proto-text bodies remain on their declaring classes.

## Known Divergences

*   **Integer Overflow:** Standard TypeScript numbers do not overflow like Go's fixed-size integers. GoScript uses `bigint` for `int64` and `uint64` values and helper functions for fixed-width normalization; smaller integer widths still use `number` and may diverge on overflow when a helper does not explicitly truncate.
*   **Floating Point Precision:** Differences may exist between Go's `float64`/`float32` and TypeScript's `number` (IEEE 754 64-bit float).
*   **`for range` Variable Scoping:** Go reuses loop variables, while GoScript's translation to `for...of` with `let` creates new bindings per iteration to avoid common closure capture bugs (see [Control Flow](#control-flow)).
*   **Concurrency Model:** `async/await` provides cooperative multitasking, differing from Go's preemptive goroutine scheduling. Subtle timing and fairness differences may exist.
*   **Panic/Recover vs. Exceptions:** While mapped, the exact stack unwinding and recovery mechanisms might differ subtly from Go's `panic`/`recover`.
*   **Zero Values:** Explicit assignment is used, but subtle differences in initialization order compared to Go's implicit zeroing might occur in complex scenarios (e.g., during package initialization).

## Future Considerations / TODO

*   Continue refining integer helper coverage so every fixed-width operation either normalizes explicitly or exposes the actual `bigint` result type.
*   Detailed design docs for Structs, Interfaces, Concurrency, Defer, Panic/Recover.
*   Build System/Package Management integration.
*   Source Maps for debugging.
*   Implement standard library including "runtime" functions

# Package Structure

This is the typical package structure of the output TypeScript import path:

```
@goscript/ # Typical Go workspace, all packages live here. Includes the '@goscript/builtin' alias for the runtime.
  # Compiled Go packages go here (e.g., @goscript/my/package)
```

# Go to TypeScript Compiler Design

## Divergences from Go

This section highlights key areas where GoScript's generated TypeScript behavior differs from standard Go, primarily due to the challenges of mapping Go's memory model and semantics directly to JavaScript/TypeScript.

• **Expression Switches:**
  - Go expression switches are not lowered by the current v2 compiler.
  - Type switches are supported through runtime type descriptors and `$.typeSwitch`; expression switches should fail with a structured unsupported lowering diagnostic until they are scoped.

## Implementation Considerations

After reviewing the code and tests, some important implementation considerations include:

1. **Pointer Comparison Implementation**:
   * Ensure pointer comparisons use appropriate TypeScript equality semantics.
   * Pointer comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `==nil`) must be correctly translated to their TypeScript equivalents.

2. **Pointer Representation, Variable References & Addressability**:
   * **Variable References:** To handle Go's pointers and addressability within JavaScript's reference model, GoScript employs a "variable reference" strategy. When the address of a variable (`&v`) is taken anywhere in the code, that variable is declared using the `$.VarRef<T>` type from the runtime (`@goscript/builtin`). This variable reference holds the actual value and allows multiple pointers to reference and modify the same underlying value.
     ```go
     // Go
     var x int = 10
     p := &x // Address of x is taken, so x must be a variable reference
     ```
     ```typescript
     // TypeScript
     import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
     let x: $.VarRef<number> = $.varRef(10) // x is a variable reference
     let p: $.VarRef<number> | null = x  // p points to the variable reference x
     ```
   * **Addressability:** Only variables that have been made variable references (because their address was taken) are addressable.
   * **Pointer Types:** Go pointer types are mapped to potentially nullable `VarRef` types in TypeScript. See the "Type Mapping" section for details.
   * **Multi-level Pointers:** A variable (which can itself be a pointer) becomes a variable reference if its own address is taken.
     ```go
     // Go (Example from tests/tests/varRef/varRef.go)
     var x int = 10      // x is a variable reference because p1 takes its address
     var p1 *int = &x    // p1 is a variable reference because p2 takes its address
     var p2 **int = &p1  // p2 is a variable reference because p3 takes its address
     var p3 ***int = &p2 // p3 is NOT a variable reference because its address is not taken
     ```
     This translates to:
     ```typescript
     // TypeScript
     import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
     let x: $.VarRef<number> = $.varRef(10);
     let p1: $.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> = $.varRef(x); // p1's variable reference holds a reference to x's variable reference
     let p2: $.VarRef<$.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> | null> = $.varRef(p1); // p2's variable reference holds a reference to p1's variable reference
     let p3: $.VarRef<$.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> | null> | null = p2; // p3 is not a variable reference; it directly holds the reference to p2's variable reference
     ```
     Dereferencing `***p3` then becomes `p3!.value!.value!.value`.

3. **Value Semantics for Structs**:
   * Go's value semantics for structs (copying on assignment) need to be properly implemented in TypeScript.
   * Method calls on value receivers versus pointer receivers need to behave consistently with Go semantics.

## Naming Conventions

- **Exported Identifiers:** Go identifiers (functions, types, variables, struct fields, interface methods) that are exported (start with an uppercase letter) retain their original PascalCase naming in the generated TypeScript code. For example, `MyFunction` in Go becomes `export function MyFunction(...)` in TypeScript, and `MyStruct.MyField` becomes `MyStruct.MyField`.
- **Unexported Identifiers:** Go identifiers that are unexported (start with a lowercase letter) retain their original camelCase naming in the generated TypeScript. If they are fields of an exported struct, they become public fields in the TypeScript class.
- **Keywords:** Go keywords are generally not an issue, but care must be taken if a Go identifier clashes with a TypeScript keyword.

## Type Mapping
- **Built-in Types:** Go built-in types are mapped to corresponding TypeScript types (e.g., `string` -> `string`, `int` -> `number`, `bool` -> `boolean`, `float64` -> `number`). If the address of a variable with a built-in type is taken, it's wrapped in `$.VarRef<T>` (e.g., `$.VarRef<number>`).

- **String and Rune Conversions:** Go's `rune` type (an alias for `int32` representing a Unicode code point) and its interaction with `string` are handled as follows:
    -   **`rune` Type:** Translated to TypeScript `number`.
    -   **`string(rune)` Conversion:** The Go conversion from a `rune` to a `string` containing that single character is translated using `String.fromCharCode()`:
        ```go
        var r rune = 'A' // Unicode point 65
        s := string(r)
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        let r: number = 65
        let s = String.fromCharCode(r) // s becomes "A"
        ```
    -   **`[]rune(string)` Conversion:** Converting a `string` to a slice of `rune`s requires a runtime helper to correctly handle multi-byte Unicode characters:
        ```go
        runes := []rune("Go€")
        ```
        becomes (conceptual translation using a runtime helper):
        ```typescript
        import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
        let runes = $.stringToRunes("Go€") // runes becomes [71, 111, 8364]
        ```
        *(This helper was also seen in the `for range` over strings translation).*
    -   **`string([]rune)` Conversion:** Converting a slice of `rune`s back to a `string` also requires a runtime helper:
        ```go
        s := string([]rune{71, 111, 8364})
        ```
        becomes (conceptual translation using a runtime helper):
        ```typescript
        import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
        let s = $.runesToString([71, 111, 8364]) // s becomes "Go€"
        ```
    *Note: Direct conversion between `string` and `[]byte` would involve different runtime helpers focusing on byte representations.*

- **Structs:** Converted to TypeScript `class`es. Both exported and unexported Go fields become `public` members in the TypeScript class. A `clone()` method is added to support Go's value semantics on assignment/read. This `clone()` method performs a deep copy of the struct's fields, including recursively cloning any nested struct fields, to ensure true value semantics.
    -   **Constructor Initialization:** The generated class constructor accepts an optional `init` object. Fields are initialized using this object. Crucially, for fields that are themselves struct *values* (not pointers):
        - If the corresponding value in `init` is provided, it is **cloned** using its `.clone()` method before assignment to maintain Go's value semantics (e.g., `this._fields.InnerStruct = $.varRef(init?.InnerStruct?.clone() ?? new InnerStruct())`).
        - If the corresponding value in `init` is nullish (`null` or `undefined`), the field is initialized with a *new instance* of the struct's zero value (`new FieldType()`) to maintain parity with Go's non-nullable struct semantics.
        - Pointer fields are initialized to `null` if the `init` value is nullish (no cloning needed).
        ```typescript
        // Example generated constructor logic for a field 'Inner' of type 'InnerStruct'
        public Inner: InnerStruct
        // ... other fields ...
        constructor(init?: { Inner?: InnerStruct /* ... other fields ... */ }) {
            this.Inner = init?.Inner?.clone() ?? new InnerStruct() // Clones if init.Inner exists, else creates zero value
            // ... other initializations ...
        }
        ```
-   **Field Access:** Accessing struct fields uses standard TypeScript dot notation (`instance.FieldName`). Go's automatic dereferencing for pointer field access (`ptr.Field`) translates to accessing the value with appropriate null checks. Unexported fields become public class members.
-   **Struct Composite Literals:**
        -   **Value Initialization (`T{...}`):** Translates to `new TypeName({...})`.
            ```go
            type Point struct{ X, Y int }
            v := Point{X: 1, Y: 2}
            ```
            becomes:
            ```typescript
            class Point { /* ... constructor, fields, clone ... */ }
            let v: Point = new Point({ X: 1, Y: 2 })
            ```
        -   **Pointer Initialization (`&T{...}`):** The implementation of pointer initialization needs to be documented after changes.

- **Interfaces:** Mapped to TypeScript `interface` types. Methods retain their original Go casing.
- **Embedded Interfaces:** Go interfaces can embed other interfaces. This is translated using TypeScript's `extends` keyword. The generated TypeScript interface extends all the interfaces embedded in the original Go interface.
        ```go
        // Go code
        type Reader interface { Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) }
        type Closer interface { Close() error }
        type ReadCloser interface {
            Reader // Embeds Reader
            Closer // Embeds Closer
        }
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        // TypeScript translation
        interface Reader {
            Read(_p0: number[]): [number, $.Error];
        }
        interface Closer {
            Close(): $.Error;
        }
        // ReadCloser extends both Reader and Closer
        interface ReadCloser extends Reader, Closer {
        }
        ```
    - **Runtime Registration:** When registering an interface type with the runtime (`$.registerInterfaceType`), the method signatures include all methods from the interface itself *and* all methods from any embedded interfaces.
        ```typescript
        // Example registration for ReadCloser
        const ReadCloser__typeInfo = $.registerInterfaceType(
          'ReadCloser',
          null, // zero value
          [
            { name: 'Close', args: [], returns: [{ type: 'error' }] },
            { name: 'Read', args: [{ type: { kind: 'slice', elemType: 'number' } }], returns: [{ type: 'number' }, { type: 'error' }] }
          ]
        );
        ```
- **Type Assertions:** Go's type assertion syntax (`i.(T)`) allows checking if an interface variable `i` holds a value of a specific concrete type `T` or implements another interface `T`. This is translated using the `$.typeAssert` runtime helper function.
    -   **Comma-Ok Assertion (`v, ok := i.(T)`):** This form checks if the assertion holds and returns the asserted value (or zero value) and a boolean status. Handled in assignment logic.
        -   **Interface-to-Concrete Example:**
            ```go
            // Go code (from tests/tests/interface_type_assertion)
            var i MyInterface
            s := MyStruct{Value: 10}
            i = s
            _, ok := i.(MyStruct) // Assert interface 'i' holds concrete type 'MyStruct'
            ```
            becomes:
            ```typescript
            // TypeScript translation
            import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin";

            let i: MyInterface;
            let s = new MyStruct({ Value: 10 })
            i = s.clone() // Assuming MyInterface holds values, clone needed

            // Assignment logic generates this:
            let { value: _, ok } = $.typeAssert<MyStruct>(i, 'MyStruct')
            if (ok) {
                console.log("Type assertion successful")
            }
            ```
        -   **Interface-to-Interface Example:**
            ```go
            // Go code (from tests/tests/embedded_interface_assertion)
            var rwc ReadCloser
            s := MyStruct{} // MyStruct implements ReadCloser
            rwc = s
            _, ok := rwc.(ReadCloser) // Assert interface 'rwc' holds type 'ReadCloser'
            ```
            becomes:
            ```typescript
            // TypeScript translation
            import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin";

            let rwc: ReadCloser;
            let s = new MyStruct({  })
            rwc = s.clone() // Assuming ReadCloser holds values

            // Assignment logic generates this:
            let { value: _, ok } = $.typeAssert<ReadCloser>(rwc, 'ReadCloser')
            if (ok) {
                console.log("Embedded interface assertion successful")
            }
            ```
        -   **Translation Details:** The Go assertion `v, ok := i.(T)` is translated during assignment (`WriteStmtAssign`) to:
            1.  A call to `$.typeAssert<T>(i, 'TypeName')`.
                *   `<T>`: The target type (interface or class) is passed as a TypeScript generic parameter.
                *   `'TypeName'`: The name of the target type `T` is passed as a string literal. This string is used by the runtime helper for type checking against registered type information.
            2.  The helper returns an object `{ value: T | null, ok: boolean }`.
            3.  Object destructuring is used to extract the `value` and `ok` properties into the corresponding variables from the Go code (e.g., `let { value: v, ok } = ...`). If a variable is the blank identifier (`_`), it's assigned using `value: _` in the destructuring pattern.

    -   **Panic Assertion (`v := i.(T)`):** This form asserts that `i` holds type `T` and panics if it doesn't. Handled in expression logic (`WriteTypeAssertExpr`). The translation uses the same `$.typeAssert` helper but wraps it in an IIFE that checks `ok` and throws an error if false, otherwise returns the `value`.
- **Slices:** Go slices (`[]T`) are mapped to the `$.Slice<T>` type which is a union: `T[] | SliceProxy<T> | null`. For complex slicing operations, a `SliceProxy<T>` is used which wraps the backing array with metadata for offset, length, and capacity. Runtime helpers from `@goscript/builtin` are crucial for correct behavior.
    -   **Representation:** A Go slice is represented in TypeScript as `$.Slice<T>` which can be a plain array, a `SliceProxy<T>` (for slices with non-zero offset or capacity different from length), or `null` (for nil slices). The `SliceProxy` uses a `__meta__` property containing `{ backing: T[], offset: number, length: number, capacity: number }`.
    -   **Creation (`make`):** `make([]T, len)` and `make([]T, len, cap)` are translated using the generic runtime helper `$.makeSlice<T>(len, cap?)`.
        ```go
        s1 := make([]int, 5)       // len 5, cap 5
        s2 := make([]int, 5, 10)  // len 5, cap 10
        var s3 []string           // nil slice
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
        let s1 = $.makeSlice<number>(5)      // Creates array len 5, sets __capacity = 5
        let s2 = $.makeSlice<number>(5, 10) // Creates array len 5, sets __capacity = 10
        let s3: $.Slice<string> = null            // Represents nil slice as null
        ```
    -   **Literals:** Slice literals are translated directly to TypeScript array literals. The capacity of a slice created from a literal is equal to its length.
        ```go
        s := []int{1, 2, 3} // len 3, cap 3
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        let s = [1, 2, 3] // Runtime helpers treat this as having __capacity = 3
        ```
    -   **Length (`len(s)`):** Uses the runtime helper `$.len(s)`. Returns `0` for nil (empty array) slices.
    -   **Capacity (`cap(s)`):** Uses the runtime helper `$.cap(s)`. This helper reads the `__capacity` property or defaults to the array's `length` if `__capacity` is not set (e.g., for plain array literals). Returns `0` for nil (empty array) slices.
    -   **Access/Assignment (`s[i]`):** Translated directly using standard TypeScript array indexing (`s[i]`). Out-of-bounds access will likely throw a runtime error in TypeScript, similar to Go's panic.
    -   **Slicing (`a[low:high]`, `a[low:high:max]`):** Slicing operations create a *new* slice header (a new TypeScript array object with its own `__capacity`) that shares the *same underlying data* as the original array or slice. This is done using the `$.goSlice` runtime helper.
        -   `a[low:high]` translates to `$.goSlice(a, low, high)`. The new slice has length `high - low` and capacity `original_capacity - low`.
        -   `a[:high]` translates to `$.goSlice(a, undefined, high)`.
        -   `a[low:]` translates to `$.goSlice(a, low, undefined)`.
        -   `a[:]` translates to `$.goSlice(a, undefined, undefined)`.
        -   `a[low:high:max]` translates to `$.goSlice(a, low, high, max)`. The new slice has length `high - low` and capacity `max - low`.
        ```go
        arr := [5]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4} // Array (len 5, cap 5)
        s1 := arr[1:4]      // [1, 2, 3], len 3, cap 4 (5-1)
        s2 := s1[1:2]       // [2], len 1, cap 3 (cap of s1 - 1)
        s3 := arr[0:2:3]    // [0, 1], len 2, cap 3 (3-0)
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        let s1 = $.goSlice(arr, 1, 4)      // len 3, __capacity 4
        let s2 = $.goSlice(s1, 1, 2)       // len 1, __capacity 3
        let s3 = $.goSlice(arr, 0, 2, 3)   // len 2, __capacity 3
        ```
        *Important:* Modifications made through a slice affect the underlying data. As demonstrated in the compliance tests (e.g., "Slicing a slice"), changes made via one slice variable (like `subSlice2` modifying index 0) are visible through other slice variables (`subSlice1`, `baseSlice`) that share the same underlying memory region.
    -   **Append (`append(s, ...)`):** Translated using the `$.append` runtime helper. Crucially, the result of `$.append` *must* be assigned back to the slice variable, as `append` may return a new slice instance if reallocation occurs.
        ```go
        s = append(s, elem1, elem2)
        s = append(s, anotherSlice...) // Spread operator
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        s = $.append(s, elem1, elem2)
        s = $.append(s, ...anotherSlice) // Spread operator
        ```
        -   **Behavior:**
            -   If appending fits within the existing capacity (`len(s) + num_elements <= cap(s)`), elements are added to the underlying array, and the original slice header's length is updated (potentially modifying the same object `s` refers to). The underlying array is modified.
            -   If appending exceeds the capacity, a *new*, larger underlying array is allocated, the existing elements plus the new elements are copied to it, and `append` returns a *new* slice header referencing this new array. The original underlying array is *not* modified beyond its bounds.
            -   Appending to a nil slice allocates a new underlying array.
- **Arrays:** Go arrays (e.g., `[5]int`) have a fixed size known at compile time. They are also mapped to TypeScript arrays (`T[]`), but their fixed-size nature is enforced during compilation (e.g., preventing `append`). Slicing an array (`arr[:]`, `arr[low:high]`, etc.) uses the `$.goSlice` helper, resulting in a Go-style slice backed by the original array data.
    -   **Sparse Array Literals:** For Go array literals with specific indices (e.g., `[5]int{1: 10, 3: 30}`), unspecified indices are filled with the zero value of the element type in the generated TypeScript. For example, `[5]int{1: 10, 3: 30}` becomes `[0, 10, 0, 30, 0]`.

*Note: The distinction between slices and arrays in Go is important. While both often map to TypeScript arrays, runtime helpers (`makeSlice`, `slice`, `len`, `cap`, `append`) and the `__capacity` property are essential for emulating Go's slice semantics accurately.*
- **Maps:** Go maps (`map[K]V`) use a `Map<K, V>` subclass created by `$.makeMap`. It indexes string keys by their Go byte value, so misses and insertions do not scan existing entries. Binary and UTF-8 string representations share a key while iteration retains the original representation. Struct keys still use Go value comparison. Various Go map operations are mapped as follows:
    -   **Creation (`make`):** `make(map[K]V)` is translated using a runtime helper:
        ```go
        m := make(map[string]int)
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"
        let m = $.makeMap<string, number>() // Using generics for type information
        ```
    -   **Literals:** Map literals use the same `$.makeMap` owner with initial entries:
        ```go
        m := map[string]int{"one": 1, "two": 2}
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        let m = $.makeMap([["one", 1], ["two", 2]])
        ```
    -   **Assignment (`m[k] = v`):** Uses a runtime helper `mapSet`:
        ```go
        m["three"] = 3
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        $.mapSet(m, "three", 3)
        ```
    -   **Access (`m[k]`):** Uses `$.mapGet` to preserve both Go key equality and presence, including a stored undefined value.
        ```go
        val := m["one"] // Assuming m["one"] exists
        zero := m["nonexistent"] // Assuming m["nonexistent"] doesn't exist
        ```
        becomes (simplified conceptual translation):
        ```typescript
        let val = $.mapGet(m, "one", 0)[0]
        let zero = $.mapGet(m, "nonexistent", 0)[0]
        ```
    -   **Comma-Ok Idiom (`v, ok := m[k]`):** Translated using `Map.has()` and `Map.get()` with zero-value handling during assignment:
        ```go
        v, ok := m["three"]
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        // Assignment logic generates this:
        let ok: boolean
        let v: number
        ok = m.has("three")
        v = m.get("three") ?? 0 // Provide zero value if key doesn't exist
        ```
    -   **Length (`len(m)`):** Uses a runtime helper `len`:
        ```go
        size := len(m)
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        let size = $.len(m) // Uses runtime helper, not Map.size directly
        ```
    -   **Deletion (`delete(m, k)`):** Uses a runtime helper `deleteMapEntry`:
        ```go
        delete(m, "two")
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        $.deleteMapEntry(m, "two")
        ```
    -   **Iteration (`for k, v := range m`):** Uses standard `Map.entries()` and `for...of`:
        ```go
        for key, value := range m {
            // ...
        }
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        for (const [k, v] of m.entries()) {
            // ... (key and value are block-scoped)
        }
        ```
    *Note: The reliance on runtime helpers (`@goscript/builtin`) is crucial for correctly emulating Go's map semantics, especially regarding zero values and potentially type information for `makeMap`.*
- **Functions:** Converted to TypeScript `function`s. Exported functions are prefixed with `export`.
- **Function Literals:** Go function literals (anonymous functions) are translated into TypeScript arrow functions (`=>`).
    ```go
    greet := func(name string) string {
        return "Hello, " + name
    }
    message := greet("world")
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    let greet = (name: string): string => { // Arrow function
        return "Hello, " + name
    }
    let message = greet("world")
    ```
- **Methods:** Go functions with receivers are generated as methods within the corresponding TypeScript `class`. They retain their original Go casing.
    -   **Receiver Type (Value vs. Pointer):** Both value receivers (`func (m MyStruct) Method()`) and pointer receivers (`func (m *MyStruct) Method()`) are translated into regular methods on the TypeScript class.
        ```go
        type Counter struct{ count int }
        func (c Counter) Value() int { return c.count } // Value receiver
        func (c *Counter) Inc()    { c.count++ }       // Pointer receiver
        ```
        becomes:
        ```typescript
        class Counter {
            private count: number = 0;
            // Receiver 'c' bound to 'this'
            public Value(): number { const c = this; return c.count; }
            public Inc(): void    { const c = this; c.count++; }
            // ... constructor, clone ...
        }
        ```
    -   **Method Calls:** Go allows calling pointer-receiver methods on values (`value.PtrMethod()`) and value-receiver methods on pointers (`ptr.ValueMethod()`) via automatic referencing/dereferencing. The translation of these in TypeScript needs to be documented after implementation changes.
    -   **Receiver Binding:** As per Code Generation Conventions, the Go receiver identifier (e.g., `c`) is bound to `this` within the method body (`const c = this`).
    -   **Semantic Note on Value Receivers:** See "Divergences from Go".

## Value Semantics

Go's value semantics (where assigning a struct copies it) are emulated in TypeScript by:
1.  Adding a `clone()` method to generated classes representing structs. This method performs a deep copy.
    -   The `clone()` method creates a new instance of the struct and then copies the values from the original struct's `_fields` to the new instance's `_fields`. For each field, the value is retrieved from the source variable reference (e.g., `this._fields.MyInt.value`) and then re-wrapped in a new variable reference in the destination (e.g., `cloned._fields.MyInt = $.varRef(...)`).
    -   For nested struct fields, the `clone()` method of the nested struct is called recursively (e.g., `cloned._fields.InnerStruct = $.varRef(this._fields.InnerStruct.value?.clone() ?? new MyStruct())`).
    ```typescript
    // Example: MyStruct.clone()
    public clone(): MyStruct {
        const cloned = new MyStruct()
        cloned._fields = {
            MyInt: $.varRef(this._fields.MyInt.value),
            MyString: $.varRef(this._fields.MyString.value)
        }
        return cloned
    }

    // Example: NestedStruct.clone() with nested MyStruct
    public clone(): NestedStruct {
        const cloned = new NestedStruct()
        cloned._fields = {
            Value: $.varRef(this._fields.Value.value),
            InnerStruct: $.varRef(this._fields.InnerStruct.value?.clone() ?? new MyStruct()) // Recursive clone
        }
        return cloned
    }
    ```
2.  Automatically calling `.clone()` during assignment statements (`=`, `:=`) whenever a struct *value* is being copied.
    -   If the source variable is a direct struct instance (not a variable reference), it's `let valueCopy = original.clone()`.
    -   If the source variable is a `$.VarRef<StructType>` (because its address was taken), the assignment becomes `let valueCopy = original.value.clone()`.
    ```go
    // Go
    original := MyStruct{MyInt: 42}
    valueCopy := original
    // (later &original might be used, causing 'original' to be a variable reference in TS)
    ```
    ```typescript
    // TypeScript (assuming 'original' is a variable reference)
    let original: $.VarRef<MyStruct> = $.varRef(new MyStruct({MyInt: 42}));
    let valueCopy = original.value.clone();
    ```
3.  Pointer assignments preserve Go's reference semantics by copying the reference to the `$.VarRef` or the direct object reference (for non-variable-reference struct pointers).

Pointer assignments are handled as described under Operators (`&`, `*`) and Pointer Representation/Variable References.

## Multi-Assignment Statements

Go's multi-assignment statements (where multiple variables are assigned in a single statement) are translated based on the RHS:
- **Multiple RHS values:** `a, b := val1, val2` becomes separate assignments `let a = compiled_val1; let b = compiled_val2`.
- **Single function call RHS:** `a, b := funcReturningTwoValues()` becomes destructuring assignment `let [a, b] = funcReturningTwoValues()`.
- **Map comma-ok RHS:** `v, ok := myMap[key]` becomes separate assignments for `ok` and `v` using `Map.has` and `Map.get`.
- **Type assertion comma-ok RHS:** `v, ok := i.(T)` becomes destructuring assignment `let { value: v, ok } = $.typeAssert(...)`.
- **Channel receive comma-ok RHS:** `v, ok := <-ch` becomes destructuring assignment `const { value: v, ok } = await ch.receiveWithOk()`.

The blank identifier (`_`) in Go results in the omission of the corresponding variable in the TypeScript assignment/destructuring pattern, though the RHS expression is still evaluated for potential side effects.

## Operators

Go operators are generally mapped directly to their TypeScript equivalents:

- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` map directly. Integer division `/` is wrapped in `Math.floor()`.
- **Comparison Operators:**
    - `==`, `!=` for **pointers**: Map directly to `===`, `!==` (reference equality).
    - `==`, `!=` for **non-pointers**: Map directly to `===`, `!==`. Struct comparison is reference equality unless specific comparison methods are defined.
    - `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`: Map directly.
- **Address Operator (`&`):**
    - Taking the address of a variable (`&v`) translates to referencing the `$.VarRef<T>` object associated with `v`.
    ```go
    var x int
    p := &x // x becomes a variable reference here
    ```
    ```typescript
    let x: $.VarRef<number> = $.varRef(0) // x declared as VarRef
    let p: $.VarRef<number> | null = x         // p gets reference to x's VarRef
    ```
- **Dereference Operator (`*`):**
    - Dereferencing a pointer (`*p`) translates to accessing the `.value` property of the corresponding `VarRef`.
    - Dereferencing a pointer to a struct depends on the context (see `design/VAR_REFS.md`).
    - **Multi-level Dereferencing:** Involves chaining `.value` accesses, corresponding to each level of variable reference for the intermediate pointers.
      ```go
      // Go (from tests/tests/varRef/varRef.go)
      // var x int = 10; var p1 *int = &x; var p2 **int = &p1; var p3 ***int = &p2;
      // x is $.VarRef<number>
      // p1 is $.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null>
      // p2 is $.VarRef<$.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> | null>
      // p3 is $.VarRef<$.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> | null> | null (refers to p2's variable reference)
      ***p3 = 12
      y := ***p3
      ```
      ```typescript
      // TypeScript
      // ... (declarations as above)
      p3!.value!.value!.value = 12
      let y: number = p3!.value!.value!.value
      ```
- **Pointer Assignment:**
    - **Assigning an address to a pointer (`p = &v`):**
        - If the pointer variable `p` on the left-hand side is *not* a variable reference, it's assigned the reference to `v`'s `$.VarRef`.
          ```go
          // Case 1: Pointer p is not a variable reference
          var x int = 10 // x will be a variable reference
          var p *int     // p is not a variable reference
          p = &x         // Assign address of x to p
          ```
          ```typescript
          let x: $.VarRef<number> = $.varRef(10)
          let p: $.VarRef<number> | null // p is not a VarRef itself
          p = x // p now holds the reference to x's VarRef
          ```
        - If the pointer variable `p1` on the left-hand side *is* a variable reference (because `&p1` was taken elsewhere), its `.value` is updated to point to `v`'s `$.VarRef`.
          ```go
          // Case 2: Pointer p1 IS a variable reference
          // Assume: var p1 $.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> (p1 was made a variable reference)
          var y int = 15 // y will be a variable reference
          p1 = &y
          ```
          ```typescript
          // Assume: let p1: $.VarRef<$.VarRef<number> | null> = ...;
          let y: $.VarRef<number> = $.varRef(15)
          p1.value = y // Update the inner value of p1's VarRef to point to y's VarRef
          ```
    - **Assigning to a dereferenced pointer (`*p = val`):** Translates to assigning to the `.value` property of the `VarRef` that `p` (or the final pointer in a chain) refers to.
      ```go
      // Assume p points to x's variable reference: p: $.VarRef<number> | null = x_varRef
      *p = 100
      ```
      ```typescript
      p!.value = 100 // Assign to the value inside the VarRef p points to
      ```
- **Bitwise Operators:** `&`, `|`, `^`, `&^`, `<<`, `>>` map to TS `&`, `|`, `^`, `& ~`, `<<`, `>>`. Bitwise NOT `^x` maps to `~x`.

## Control Flow

### For Statements

Go has a single `for` construct. We map it to TypeScript's `for` and `while` loops.

*   **Standard `for` loop (init; condition; post):**
    ```go
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        // ...
    }
    ```
    Translates directly to a TypeScript `for` loop:
    ```typescript
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // ...
    }
    ```
    Variable scoping within the loop follows Go rules, potentially requiring temporary variables in TypeScript if loop variables are captured in closures.

*   **`while` loop (condition only):**
    ```go
    for condition {
        // ...
    }
    ```
    Translates to a TypeScript `while` loop:
    ```typescript
    while (condition) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

*   **Infinite loop:**
    ```go
    for {
        // ...
    }
    ```
    Translates to an infinite TypeScript `for` loop:
    ```typescript
    for (;;) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

*   **`for range` loop:**
    The Go specification states that the range expression (the collection being iterated over) is evaluated *once* before the loop begins.

    *   **Slices and Arrays:**
        ```go
        s := []int{10, 20, 30}
        for i, v := range s {
            // ... use i and v
        }
        for i := range s {
            // ... use i
        }
        ```
        Translated using indexed `for` loops with `$.len()`:
        ```typescript
        import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"

        let s: number[] = [10, 20, 30]
        // index and value
        for (let i = 0; i < $.len(s); i++) {
            let v = s![i]
            // ... use i and v
        }
        // index only
        for (let i = 0; i < $.len(s); i++) {
            // ... use i
        }
        ```

    *   **Maps:**
        ```go
        m := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2}
        for k, v := range m {
            // ... use k and v
        }
        ```
        Translated using `.entries()`:
        ```typescript
        let m = new Map([["a", 1], ["b", 2]])
        for (const [k, v] of m?.entries() ?? []) {
            // ... use k and v
        }
        ```

    *   **Strings:**
        ```go
        s := "hello"
        for i, r := range s {
            // ... use i (byte index) and r (rune)
        }
        ```
        Translated using `$.stringToRunes()`:
        ```typescript
        {
            const _runes = $.stringToRunes(s)
            for (let i = 0; i < _runes.length; i++) {
                let r = _runes[i]
                // ... use i and r
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Channels:**
        ```go
        for v := range ch {
            // ... use v
        }
        ```
        Translated to an infinite loop with receive:
        ```typescript
        for (;;) {
            const { value: v, ok: _ok } = await $.chanRecvWithOk(ch)
            if (!_ok) break
            // ... use v
        }
        ```

    *   **Integers (Go 1.22+):**
        ```go
        for i := range 10 {
            // ... use i
        }
        ```
        Translated directly:
        ```typescript
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // ... use i
        }
        ```

### Break and Continue

`break` and `continue` statements are translated directly to their TypeScript counterparts. Labeled `break` and `continue` are also supported and map directly to labeled statements in TypeScript.

## Control Flow: `switch` Statements

Go's `switch` statement is translated into a standard TypeScript `switch` statement.

-   **Basic Switch:**
    ```go
    switch value {
    case 1:
        // do something
    case 2, 3: // Multiple values per case
        // do something else
    default:
        // default action
    }
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    switch (value) {
        case 1:
            // do something
            break // Automatically added
        case 2: // Multiple Go cases become separate TS cases
        case 3:
            // do something else
            break // Automatically added
        default:
            // default action
            break // Automatically added
    }
    ```
    *Note: `break` statements are automatically inserted at the end of each translated `case` block to replicate Go's default behavior of not falling through.*

-   **Switch without Expression:** A Go `switch` without an expression (`switch { ... }`) is equivalent to `switch true { ... }` and is useful for cleaner if/else-if chains. This translates similarly, comparing `true` against the case conditions.
    ```go
    switch {
    case x < 0:
        // negative
    case x == 0:
        // zero
    default: // x > 0
        // positive
    }
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    switch (true) {
        case x < 0:
            // negative
            break
        case x == 0:
            // zero
            break
        default:
            // positive
            break
    }
    ```
-   **Fallthrough:** Go's explicit `fallthrough` keyword is *not* currently supported and would require specific handling if implemented.

-   **Type Switch:** Go's type switch statement, which switches on the dynamic type of an interface value, is translated using the `$.typeSwitch` runtime helper.
    ```go
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case int:
        // v is int
    case string:
        // v is string
    case MyStruct:
        // v is MyStruct
    default:
        // v is the original interface value
    }
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    $.typeSwitch(i, [
        {
            types: [{ kind: 'basic', name: 'int' }],
            body: (v: number) => {
                // v is number
            }
        },
        {
            types: [{ kind: 'basic', name: 'string' }],
            body: (v: string) => {
                // v is string
            }
        },
        {
            types: ['MyStruct'],  // Registered type name
            body: (v: MyStruct) => {
                // v is MyStruct
            }
        }
    ], () => {
        // default case
    })
    ```
    The `$.typeSwitch` helper iterates through cases and executes the body of the first matching type. For single-type cases, `$.typeAssert` is used internally to get the typed value. For multi-type cases (`case int, string:`), `$.is` is used to check if any type matches.

## Control Flow: `select` Statements

Go's `select` statement, used for channel communication, is translated using a runtime helper:

```go
select {
case val, ok := <-ch1:
    // Process received value
case ch2 <- value:
    // Process after sending
default:
    // Default case
}
```

becomes:

```typescript
import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin"

await $.selectStatement([
    {
        id: 0,  // Unique identifier for this case
        isSend: false,  // This is a receive operation
        channel: ch1,
        onSelected: async (result) => {
            // Assignment logic handles declaration
            const { value: val, ok } = result
            // Process received value
        }
    },
    {
        id: 1,  // Unique identifier for this case
        isSend: true,  // This is a send operation
        channel: ch2,
        value: value,
        onSelected: async () => {
            // Process after sending
        }
    }
], true)  // true indicates there's a default case
```

The `selectStatement` helper takes an array of case objects, each containing:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the case
- `isSend`: Boolean indicating whether this is a send (`true`) or receive (`false`) operation
- `channel`: The channel to operate on
- `value`: (For send operations) The value to send
- `onSelected`: Callback function that runs when this case is selected

For receive operations, the callback receives a `result` object with `value` and `ok` properties, similar to Go's comma-ok syntax. The second parameter to `selectStatement` indicates whether the `select` has a default case.

## Control Flow: `if` Statements

Go's `if` statements are translated into standard TypeScript `if` statements.

-   **Basic `if`/`else if`/`else`:**
    ```go
    if condition1 {
        // block 1
    } else if condition2 {
        // block 2
    } else {
        // block 3
    }
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    if (condition1) {
        // block 1
    } else if (condition2) {
        // block 2
    } else {
        // block 3
    }
    ```

-   **`if` with Short Statement:** Go allows an optional short statement (typically variable initialization) before the condition. The scope of variables declared in the short statement is limited to the `if` (and any `else if`/`else`) blocks. This is translated by declaring the variable(s) before the `if` statement in TypeScript, often within a simple block `{}` to mimic the limited scope.
    ```go
    if v := computeValue(); v > 10 {
        // use v
    } else {
        // use v
    }
    // v is not accessible here
    ```
    becomes:
    ```typescript
    { // Block to limit scope
        let v = computeValue()
        if (v > 10) {
            // use v
        } else {
            // use v
        }
    }
    // v is not accessible here
    ```

## Zero Values

Go's zero values are mapped as follows:
- `number`: `0`
- `string`: `""`
- `boolean`: `false`
- `struct`: `new TypeName()` (Value type `T`)
- `pointer`: `null` 
- `interface`, `slice`, `map`, `channel`, `function`: `null` or empty equivalent (`[]`, `new Map()`, etc. depending on context and runtime helpers).

## Packages and Imports

- Go packages are mapped to TypeScript modules under the `@goscript/` scope (e.g., `import { MyType } from '@goscript/my/package';`).
- The GoScript runtime is imported using the `@goscript/builtin` alias, which maps to the `gs/builtin/index.ts` file.
- Standard Go library packages might require specific runtime implementations or shims.

## Code Generation Conventions

- **No Trailing Semicolons:** Generated TypeScript code omits semicolons at end of statements. Statements are line-separated without `;`.

## Asynchronous Operations (Async/Await)

GoScript handles Go's concurrency primitives (like channels and potentially goroutines in the future) by mapping them to TypeScript's `async`/`await` mechanism where appropriate.

### Function Coloring

To determine which functions need to be marked `async` in TypeScript, the compiler performs a "function coloring" analysis during compilation:

1.  **Base Cases (Async Roots):**
    *   A function is inherently **Asynchronous** if its body contains:
        *   A channel receive operation (`<-ch`).
        *   A channel send operation (`ch <- val`).
        *   A `select` statement.
        *   A goroutine creation (`go` statement).
2.  **Propagation:**
    *   A function is marked **Asynchronous** if it directly calls another function that is already marked **Asynchronous**.
3.  **Default:**
    *   If a function does not meet any of the asynchronous criteria above, it is considered **Synchronous**.

### Analysis Phase

The GoScript compiler incorporates a dedicated analysis phase that executes after parsing and type checking but before code generation. This phase performs a comprehensive traversal of the Go Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), leveraging type information provided by the `go/packages` and `go/types` libraries. The primary goal is to gather all necessary information about the code's structure, semantics, and potential runtime behavior upfront.

All collected information is stored in a read-only `Analysis` struct. This ensures that the subsequent code generation phase can focus solely on translating the AST into TypeScript based on pre-computed facts, without needing to perform complex analysis or maintain mutable state during writing.

Key responsibilities of the analysis phase include:

- **Processing Imports:** Collects and organizes import information, including import paths and aliased names, for use in generating TypeScript import statements.
- **Handling Comment Maps:** Associates comments with the relevant AST nodes, preserving comments for inclusion in the generated code.
- **Analyzing Asynchronous Operations and Defer Statements:**
    - Identifies which functions (including function literals) are asynchronous based on the presence of channel operations, `select` statements, goroutine creations, or calls to other asynchronous functions. This "function coloring" is essential for generating correct `async`/`await` code.
    - Determines which code blocks contain `defer` statements.
    - Specifically identifies if a `defer` statement refers to an asynchronous function literal. This information is used to decide whether to use `await using $.AsyncDisposableStack()` for the block and generate an `async () => { ... }` callback for the deferred function.
- **Analyzing Unexported Field Access:** Unexported fields of structs are translated as public fields in TypeScript. Go's package-level visibility for unexported fields is not strictly enforced in the generated TypeScript; all fields become public.

By performing these analyses ahead of time, the compiler simplifies the code generation process and improves the overall correctness and maintainability of the generated TypeScript code.

### Channel Operations

Channel operations are translated as follows:

-   **Creation:** `make(chan T, capacity)` is translated to `$.makeChannel<T>(capacity, zeroValueOfTypeT)`. For unbuffered channels (`make(chan T)`), the capacity is `0`.
-   **Receive:** `val := <-ch` is translated to `val = await $.chanRecv(ch)`. The `$.chanRecv` helper handles nil channels (blocks forever).
-   **Receive (comma-ok):** `val, ok := <-ch` is translated to `const { value: val, ok } = await $.chanRecvWithOk(ch)`.
-   **Send:** `ch <- val` is translated to `await $.chanSend(ch, val)`. The `$.chanSend` helper handles nil channels (blocks forever).
-   **Close:** `close(ch)` is translated to `ch.close()`.

### Goroutines

Go's goroutine creation (`go func() { ... }()`) is translated to a call to `queueMicrotask` with the target function wrapped in an async arrow function:

```go
go func() {
    // Goroutine body
}()
```

becomes:

```typescript
queueMicrotask(async () => {
    {
        // Goroutine body
    }
})
```

### TypeScript Generation

## Functions

-   **Async Functions:** Go functions colored as **Asynchronous** are generated as TypeScript `async function`s. Their return type `T` is wrapped in a `Promise<T>`. If the function has no return value, the TypeScript return type is `Promise<void>`.
-   **Sync Functions:** Go functions colored as **Synchronous** are generated as regular TypeScript `function`s with their corresponding return types.
-   **Function Calls:** When a Go function call targets an **Asynchronous** function, the generated TypeScript call expression is prefixed with the `await` keyword. Calls to **Synchronous** functions are generated directly without `await`.

This coloring approach ensures that asynchronous operations propagate correctly through the call stack in the generated TypeScript code.

### Async Example

Consider the following Go code using a channel:

```go
package main

// This function receives from a channel, making it async.
func receiveFromChan(ch chan int) int {
	val := <-ch // This operation makes the function async
	return val
}

// This function calls an async function, making it async too.
func caller(ch chan int) int {
	// We expect this call to be awaited in TypeScript
	result := receiveFromChan(ch)
	return result + 1
}

func main() {
	myChan := make(chan int, 1)
	myChan <- 10
	finalResult := caller(myChan)
	println(finalResult) // Expected output: 11
	close(myChan)
}

```

This translates to the following TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as $ from "@goscript/builtin";

// Marked async because it contains 'await ch.receive()'
async function receiveFromChan(ch: $.Channel<number>): Promise<number> {
	let val = await ch.receive()
	return val
}

// Marked async because it calls the async 'receiveFromChan'
async function caller(ch: $.Channel<number>): Promise<number> {
	let result = await receiveFromChan(ch)
	return result + 1
}

// Marked async because it calls the async 'caller' and uses 'await myChan.send()'
export async function main(): Promise<void> {
	let myChan = $.makeChannel<number>(1, 0)
	await myChan.send(10) // Send is awaited
	let finalResult = await caller(myChan)
	console.log(finalResult)
	myChan.close()
}

```

*Note on Microtasks:* While Go's concurrency model involves goroutines and a scheduler, the TypeScript translation primarily uses `async`/`await` and Promises for channel operations. Starting a new Goroutine with the `go` keyword is translated to a call to `queueMicrotask` with the target function,  scheduling it to run asynchronously.
